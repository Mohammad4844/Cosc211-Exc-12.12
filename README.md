*The Files being used in the Test can be found [here](Excercise-12.12/test/pkg/) along with the JUnit one. Note that these are the unedited version, those that use 'next line' brace style.
## Opinion about the assignment
The changes definetly did improve the readablilty of the code. I was able to name the mehods with really descriptive names. Each and every method does 1 specifc task (or at least it tries to). Because of these, its really easy to follow the code despite them being broken into many different methods. Also, the JavaDocs for most of the methods fell unneccessary because the names were descriptive enoug (but I still added them just in case).
<br>
The 6 line rule in my opinion was good to, but just for this asignment. In this assignment I was able to break the code down, but I could think of alot of cases where trying to reduce the lines to 6 this much would make the code hard to read/understand, or even in some cases impossible to write.

*Eclipse's method refactoring is really helpful when doing such breakdowns. I finished the assignment before I realized this was an option, but I tried it out and it seems like a relatively convenient way to to this.
## Some extra notes
1) The program doesnt work for files that have empty lines in them. This is how the original file was, so I didnt bother changing it.
2) The JUnit test causes the Test files to change, so uou can only run it once. If you want to run it again and actually test the program, youd have to undo the changes in the Test files after they are formatted.
